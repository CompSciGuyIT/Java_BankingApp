# Java_BankingApp

The goal is to create a simple banking app to demonstrate autoboxing and unboxing.
There should be 3 main classes: Bank, Branch, and Customer, each with their own ArrayList.

The Bank class has an ArrayList of Branches, the Branch class has an ArrayList of Customers, and the Customer class has 
an ArrayList of Transactions (doubles).

The Branch class needs to   - Add a new customers with an initial transaction amount.
                            - Add additional transactions for Customer/Branch
                            
The Bank class needs to     - Add a new Branch
                            - Add a Customer to a Branch with an initial transaction
                            - Add a Transaction for an existing Customer at the Branch
                            - Display a list of Customers for a Branch, and optionally a list of their transactions
                            
Some sort of data validation must be implemented.
